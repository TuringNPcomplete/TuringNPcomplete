# Hello Earthlings!

My name is Mustapha (pronounced moos-ta-fa not moo-fa-sa), and I am currently working and researching on:

- Analytics for fast paced sports <Events detection, frame annotation, and analysis of tracking and events data>
- Healthcare AI <AI for medical diagnosis, Glaucoma diagnosis using the Retina Fundus Images for Glaucoma Analysis (RIGA) dataset

I **enjoy** talking about coding and new project ideas, so don't hesitate to say hi!
